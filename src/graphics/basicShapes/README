All the basic shapes in this folder should be immutable.

The methods within are roughly organized as such:
Constructors
Book-keeping
Properties
Transforms
Graphics
Other

Each one of these sections is marked in-code with a comment similar to:
	// **********Graphics**********
	
Any new methods should fit within one of these categories, especially Properties, which includes pretty much all getters.
